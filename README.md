# Daily Automation Codes
Here I'll put the some codes that are useful to use daily.

### passgenerator.py
This code generate a password with the **8 characters of length**. When you'll use this, just execute the code like below and put the maximum size that you expect to your password.

Inside the directory that you clone this git or put this code, execute the code like the below:

```python
print("Hello World!")
python3 passgenerator.py 18
```
In the sample above, I want to a password with the 18 characters of length at maximum. If you want less or more, just change the number in the final of call of code.
