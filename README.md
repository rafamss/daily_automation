# Daily Automation Codes
Here I'll put the some codes that are useful to use daily.

### passgenerator.py
This code generate a password with the **8 characters of length** at minimum. When you'll use this, just execute the code like below and put the maximum size that you expect to your password.

Inside the directory that you clone this git or put this code, execute the code like the below:

`python3 passgenerator.py 18`

The output will be some like this:  [[https://github.com/rafamss/daily_automation/blob/master/passgenerator_result.png]]

In the sample above, I want to a password with the 18 characters of length **at maximum** (the password can be less that the maximum size or be equal to the maximum number of characters). If you want less or more, just change the number in the final of call of code.
